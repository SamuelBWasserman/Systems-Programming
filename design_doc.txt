Design:
We traverse the directory, forking on CSV's and directories, and call the code from project 0 to handle CSV's.

Assumptions:
We assume that a correct CSV is a csv that ends with .csv and has 28 columns.
We assume that the column headers are the same as movie_metadata.csv from Project 0.


Difficulties:
It was difficult to count the number of processes and traverse directories.

Testing:
We created directories using the csv from the last project modified for size etc.

Extra Credit:
N/A

Using our code:
We ran our code with
gcc sorter.c -o sorter
./sorter -c (column) -d (directory) -o (output_directory)
